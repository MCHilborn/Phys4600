Programming of microcontrollers
RS232 comm, SPI, I^2C interfaces

Atmel studio: IDE for microcontrollers

What is a microcontroller? It's a computer.
Main difference: Architecture

PC's are generally Von Neumann architecture.
Memory is DRAM: A bunch of capacitors
Volatile memory: requires power to hold data.

Storing data in a less volatile way is required.
Microcontrollers use a different architecture: harvard or modern harvard architecture.

Program Memory       &        Data Memory
Flash memory		      SRAM
Non volatile		      volatile
Program instructions

We are using ATMEGA328P
Used in arduino.

GPIO: General purpose input/output pins, Set to high/low.
In groups called ports.

Also has ADC pins
(10 bit)

Serial interfaces
UART Rx & Tx pins

SPI
MISO MOSI SCK and SS

I^2C
two-wire interface

RESET pin allows the program to restart
Usually set to high, resets on low
