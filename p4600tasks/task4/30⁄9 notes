Don't do this:

mean()
{
loop through everything
printf() //makes it less useful
}

stdev()
{
loop through everything
call mean function in every iteration of the loop
}

two ways to get around calculating mean twice:
1) have stdev require mean as an argument
2) have a stdev argument that is a pointer to a variable which will hold the mean
float m;
s = stdev(data, &m);


Errors
4 levels of errors
Errors and warnings
if error occurs, code will not compile.
warning will still compile. May not link later.

misspelling stuff is most common of first level "compiler error"

syntax error: doing things not allowed in C language
examples: missed semicolons, assigning things of wrong type (incompatible types)


.c --compiles--> .o--link-->executable

Linking errors
Number one error is when your object file doesn't actually contain the function definition required. (for example forgot to compile another file which has the function definition).

math errors (dividing by zero)

segmentation fault: accessing memory you shouldn't access.

runtime errors: very complicated

logic errors: set up program to do something you don't want to do. Program works but the answers are wrong.
