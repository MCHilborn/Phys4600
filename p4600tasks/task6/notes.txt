Interfacing with two devices (how to differentiate)

viFindRsrc(defaultRM, "USB[0-9]::?*INSTR",....); //this finds a list of all resources that are attached to the machine
which are in the search parameters (second argument)
All instruments that this can find have that identifier.
USB0 --> connected via USB port 0
::[Hex]::[Hex]::[longer hex]::INSTR
three hex numbers mean something but are unique to each instrument.
pattern: manufacturer ID :: (supposed to be) type of instrument::product ID
tektronix: 0x0699
RIGOL: 0x1AB1 (probably)
viOpen(default RM, description, ..., &scopeHandle); //open the instrument

we need to give each instrument its own handle

viSession scopeHandle; //nothing special about it being called scope handle
viSession FGHandle; //function generator's handle
need to associate FGHandle with the right instrument

do 2 searches
Search for
viFindRsrc(defaultRM,"USB[0-9]::0x699?*instr",..) // finds tektronix instrument

viFindRsrc(defaultRM,"USB[0-9]::0x1AB1?*instr",..) //finds rigol instrument

Interact with scope:
viWrite(scopeHandle,"*IDN?\n",6,...);

interact with FG:
viWrite(FGHandle,"*IDN?\n",6,...);

all instruments accept the IDN instruction
