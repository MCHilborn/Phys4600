ADC & DAC
del T = frequency
del V = # bits
# steps = 2^n
ADC value 0->2^n-1
ADC value = Vin(2^n)/Vref

ADC done by comparitor

2 ways: Flash ADC (requires lots of components, very fast)

Staircase/Counter ADC
Uses a DAC & Timer
Steps up voltage until it is the same as the input voltage
Slow process

SAR (successive approximation ADC)
